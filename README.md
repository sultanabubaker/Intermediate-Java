Intermediate-Java
=================

More complex projects that would typically be encountered in a second Java class, with an emphasis on data structures

##Summary
This repository will contain a large number of Java projects and assignments. The level of difficulty will be similar to what may be encountered in an intermediate or second-level college class.

While the assignments are drawn from a variety of sources, the provided solutions are my own unless otherwise noted (in which case they will be modified from the original solution to a certain extent). You can use the code within this repository as you please. I welcome your criticisms, contributions, and suggestions. You won't find anything groundbreaking here.

##Approach
The code provided should be viewed as an educational resource rather than an exhibition of the pinnacle of my abilities as a programmer. While my book walkthrough provides relevant examples and (at times) detailed explanations, the projects in this repo will assume understanding of certain concepts. If you are progressing through the projects in sequence and notice a major gap in your knowledge, I recommend looking at my beginner repo (currently incomplete) or my walkthrough repo (current at chapter 8).

Some of these projects, when originally assigned, contained directions pertaining to what methods and classes should exist in the final product. I have not included those directions, nor conformed to them in revisions of old projects, because I think that it stifles creativity and lessens the difficulty of assignments.

While those experienced with Java may find these exercises to be easy, a rare few assignments have one-step solutions. You will find these to require some degree of planning. Keep track of the time you spend planning, implementing solutions (writing code), and testing. As you progress, aside from an overall decrease in your time spent from start to finish, you will observe interesting changes in the time spent in those three areas. 

Mastering the "intermediate" is an important step in becoming a competent and productive developer. Working through these projects before you enroll in, or while you are simultaneously taking a class with projects of similar difficult will guarantee you a fantastic grade.

##Statement on Academic Dishonesty
Please don't use any of these assignments to cheat in a class. If you are a student or professor and notice major similarities between a program covered here and a class assignment, please let me know and I will gladly hide the repo until the project's due-date, in the interest of fairness. 

All of my own assignments contained within this repository have been committed after the course has concluded. Commits were made with the understanding the assignment prompts aren't recycled within the department and programs will be removed immediately if I discover otherwise.

##From Another Language
You can be an experienced programmer without ever having worked with Java. If you're ready to jump in without too much guidance, these programs can be very helpful and will probably allow for a quicker transition than more trivial examples.

##Style
I try my best to conform to Google Style

##Repositories I like:
I am currently doing a walkthrough of Liang's Intro to Java 9th edition. You can find it here: 

##Arrangement
Each folder should contain the assignment as a readme file as well as my solution and any other elements necessary to test the program's functionality. For now, the order represents the assigned order which can be interpreted as an order of ascending difficulty.
